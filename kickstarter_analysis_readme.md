# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to look at the given set of Kickstarter data and be able to see the trends and relationships within the data. We are trying to help the cilent figure out how her play compared to others with respect to launch dates and their fundrasing goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From the chart provided in this repository, named Theater Outcomes vs Launch Date, we can see a better visual representation of what time of year to open plays in a theater.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

From the chart provided in this repository, named Outcomes vs Goals, we can see and gather how much funding will be needed in order for your play to run successfully.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Most of the difficulties I faced was in the syntax of the formulas. During a study group we all went over where our formulas were having errors and sorted out what we all needed to do in order to get the correct data. Another thing that we used was double checking with our filters on the data to prove that the formula was correct.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

I see a higher success rates with opening a theater in the summer months of May, June and July. I also see a lower success rate in the winter months of November, December and January.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I see the data being very mixed as far as the amount of the goal.  The most successful fundrasing goal seems to be when the price is less than $1,000 dollars.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some of the limitations are we are only looking at one funding website as compared to the multiple websites that can be use such as GoFundMe etc. Another limitation is that we only selected 4,000 of the kickstarters and not all of the kickstarters in the group.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Some other graphs that can be created are looking at the state that the play was produced in and seeing if that has an effect on the time of year to open the play as many places are very different in the same season. Furthermore, we can also create a table on how many big donators actually helped with making plays get funded.
